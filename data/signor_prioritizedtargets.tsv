The major phosphopeptides derived from biosynthetically labeled c-fos correspond to phosphopeptides generated after phosphorylation of c-fos in vitro with both rsk and map kinase. The phosphorylation sites identified for rsk (ser-362) and map kinase (ser-374) are in the transrepression domain. Cooperative phosphorylation at these sites by both enzymes was observed in vitro and reflected in vivo by the predominance of the peptide phosphorylated on both sites, as opposed to singly phosphorylated peptides. This study suggests a role for nuclear rsk and map kinase in modulating newly synthesized c-fos phosphorylation and downstream signaling.	0.515	SIGNOR-37154

The major phosphopeptides derived from biosynthetically labeled c-fos correspond to phosphopeptides generated after phosphorylation of c-fos in vitro with both rsk and map kinase. The phosphorylation sites identified for rsk (ser-362) and map kinase (ser-374) are in the transrepression domain. Cooperative phosphorylation at these sites by both enzymes was observed in vitro and reflected in vivo by the predominance of the peptide phosphorylated on both sites, as opposed to singly phosphorylated peptides. This study suggests a role for nuclear rsk and map kinase in modulating newly synthesized c-fos phosphorylation and downstream signaling.	0.2	SIGNOR-252789

ROC analysis gives AUC = 0.78 (Figure S4A) when considering high-confidence known coupling data and suggested a threshold of LogRAi ≥ -1.0 for defining true couplings. | The score associated to this interaction has a LogRAi ≥ -1.0.	0.506	SIGNOR-256783

CCL2	protein	P13500	UNIPROT	Inflammation	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH12	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									32446778	NO		Luana	In this scenario,the release by immune effector cells of large amounts of pro-in-flammatory cytokines (IFNŒ±, IFNŒ≥, IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33,TNFŒ±, TGFŒ≤) and chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3,CCL5) precipitates and sustains the aberrant systemic inflammatory response.	0.7	SIGNOR-261317
CCL2	protein	P13500	UNIPROT	Macrophage_activation	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH126	SIGNOR	up-regulates				10090									32283152	NO		miannu	The rapid replication of SARS-CoV in BALB/c mice induces the delayed release of IFN-Î±/Î², which is accompanied by the influx of many pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages. The accumulated mononuclear macrophages receive activating signals through the IFN-Î±/Î² receptors on their surface and produce more monocyte chemoattractants (such as CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12), resulting in the further accumulation of mononuclear macrophages.	0.7	SIGNOR-260849
CCL2	protein	P13500	UNIPROT	ARDS	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH128	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									32446778	NO		miannu	Taken together, these data clearly indicate that, in SARS-CoV in-fection, ARDS is the ultimate result of a cytokine storm. In this scenario,the release by immune effector cells of large amounts of pro-in-flammatory cytokines (IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33,TNFα, TGFβ) and chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3,CCL5) precipitates and sustains the aberrant systemic inflammatoryresponse. The cytokine storm is readily followed by theimmune system “attacking” the body, which in turn will cause ARDSand multiple organ failure, the final result being death, at least in themost severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection	0.7	SIGNOR-261032

These inflammatory cytokines may activate the T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell response. Th1 activation is a key event in the activation of specific immunity.	0.7	SIGNOR-261027
KIF1A	protein	Q12756	UNIPROT	Dense-core_vesicle_exocytosis	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH184	SIGNOR	up-regulates				10116									30021165	NO		miannu	To better understand how KIF1A-driven dense core vesicle (DCV) transport is regulated, we identified the KIF1A interactome and focused on three binding partners, the calcium binding protein calmodulin (CaM) and two synaptic scaffolding proteins: liprin-α and TANC2. We showed that calcium, acting via CaM, enhances KIF1A binding to DCVs and increases vesicle motility. In contrast, liprin-α and TANC2 are not part of the KIF1A-cargo complex but capture DCVs at dendritic spines	0.7	SIGNOR-266893
